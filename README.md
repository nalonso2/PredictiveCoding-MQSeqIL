Code for paper "Understanding and Improving Optimization in Predictive Coding Networks" by Nick Alonso, Jeff Krichmar, and Emre Neftci.


All of the simulations and the associated plots should be producible simply by running the command: python main.py

Details to note:

1. The simulations in the paper were produced with pytorch 1.10 and python 3.7.6
2. In order to reproduce results for tiny imagenet, the dataset will have to be downloaded prior to running main and the associated directory will have to be added to the train_contImgN.py file.
